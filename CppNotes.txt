These are header/directives files in CPP:
- algorithm
- bitset
- complex
- dequeue
-exception
-fstream
-functional
-iomanip
-ios
-iosfwd
-iostream #this is the in\output stream. the compiler cant handle cout/cin if you dont
-iterator
-limits
-list
-locale
-map
-mempory
-new
-numeric
-ostream
-queue
-set
-sstream
-stack
-stdexcept
-streambuf
-string #this is for better string concat and vari assgin
-typeinfo
-utility
-valarray
-vector

#these are the header files for CPP. I dont know what all of em yet.
using namespace is so the compiler can understand std namespaces(ima assume using global scopes in the int main())


I think you can use C directives in Cpp. Hol up:#refer ro Experment.exe
    ok so that shit works. Crazy, I mean we dont call it Grandaddy C. for no reason

obj.length()-> object.method()

global define functions are funtions that come with a directive
getline() is a Global function, that gets an input and put in a vari(its a string):
     getline(cin, vari)
	esc charaters are not allowed

it starts at the iostream:
    then it goes to istream
    or it goes to the ostream
	then it ends at the ios

cin - Obj of class istream to control standard input
cout - Obj of class ostream to control standard output
cerr - Obj of class ostream to control unbuffered error output
clog - Obj of class ostream to control buffered error output

There are new in/output classes.
whole new library for it:
    its in iostream
ios is the base class:
     it share classes and methods with all stream classes
istream is used more for reading the stream 
ostream is used more for writing stream

cin,cout is for writeing and reading input on the window
cerr, clog is to display error on the window or Whateva file you output on.
